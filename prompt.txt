Let's implement a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) associative storage and categorizer in Python. Let's call this data structure a ontodag. You can store items into a ontodag and recall items from it. Each item will have a name (a string). To store or "put" an item into a ontodag, you give it a name and a set of other names of already existing items that are its supercategories. Give an error if the given supercategory name does not exist. Insert the new item into the DAG by adding edges from all the supercategories specified. To recall or "get", you specify a set of item names, and you should get all items that are subcategories of all these items. Can we do this step by step. Let's start by implementing the DAG data structure.
